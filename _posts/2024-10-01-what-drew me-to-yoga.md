{% newthought 'What drew me to Yoga?' %}<!--more-->

What drew me to yoga was the need for an outlet during the pandemic...

My gym had closed, and I was stuck working a desk job from home. I had a personal calisthenics practice, but my body was riddled with aches and painsâ€”my back, shoulders, and core all suffered. I had already been in physical therapy for a tight psoas and some other core dysfunction issue before the pandemic.

On top of that, I was stressed and alone. My mom had just finished chemo after battling breast cancer, and I broke up with my girlfriend the day the pandemic lockdown was announced.

I was **lost**, searching for something... and I found yoga.
