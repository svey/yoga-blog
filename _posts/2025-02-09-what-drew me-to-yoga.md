I started practicing yoga during the pandemic. At the time, I had a regular calisthenics routine and worked out several times a week, but I still felt off — physically, mentally, and emotionally. My mom had recently completed chemotherapy for breast cancer, I had gone through a breakup, and most of my friends were isolating. It was a difficult time, and my usual ways of coping weren’t enough. That’s when I found yoga.
