My yoga journey began during the pandemic. I had a calisthenics routine, I practiced several times a week, still my mental, physical, and spiritual health were all suffering. I was stressed, my support system was guttedâ€” my mom had just finished chemotherapy and her battle with breast cancer, I split with my girlfriend. I was **lost** and then I found yoga.
