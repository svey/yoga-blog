I'm currently in enrolled in the **Diable Valley College Yoga Teacher Training** taught by **Dr. Milissa Bradley**.

It's been an incredible experience. The program covers anatomy, philosophy, teaching methodology, and yoga techniques. The coursework, while rewarding, is also physically and mentally demanding. It has expanded my understanding of yoga, beyond the physical practice, as a discipline that requires immense dedication from teachers and practitioners on and off the mat. There is a lot of effort, passion, and work yoga teachers do behind the scenes.

If you ever have the opportunity to enroll, or take a class from Dr. Bradley you shouldâ€”even if you have no interest in becoming a yoga teacher. You will grow in so many unexpected ways that will benefit your life.
