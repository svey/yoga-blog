{% newthought 'My First Yoga Teacher Training' %}<!--more-->

I'm currently in enrolled in the Diable Valley College Yoga Teacher Training 200-Hour certificate program (DVC YTT 200). It has been an **incredible experience**. {% marginnote 'shout out to dr b and cohort' 'Shout out to Dr. Milissa Bradley and my classmates!' %} I've studied anatomy, philosophy, teaching methodology, and yoga techniques. The coursework is physically and mentally demanding but also very rewarding. The program has completely changed my understanding of yoga—not just as a physical practice but as a discipline that requires immense dedication from teachers and practitioners. I've gained a new appreciation for the effort and passion that yoga teachers bring to their students and the work that goes on behind the scenes.

The entire program is taught by Dr. Milissa Bradley. If you ever have the opportunity to take her classes, you should—even if you have no interest in becoming a yoga teacher. You will grow in so many unexpected ways that will benefit your life.

Something that continually stands out to me is how supportive, vulnerable, and hardworking my classmates are. **Seriously, they. are. awesome.**
