{% newthought 'What is it like going through a 200-hour yoga certification?' %}<!--more-->


The 200-hour yoga certification has been an **incredible experience**. {% marginnote 'shout out to dr b and cohort' 'Shout out to Dr. Milissa Bradley and my classmates!' %} I'm in a unique program, DVC Yoga Teacher Training 200-Hour certificate, at Diablo Valley Community College, where I've studied anatomy, philosophy, teaching methods, and techniques. The coursework is both physically and mentally demanding but also very rewarding.

{% newthought 'How has it changed my understanding of yoga?' %}

It has completely changed my understanding of yoga—not just as a physical practice but as a discipline that requires immense dedication from teachers and practitioners. I've gained a new appreciation for the effort and passion that yoga teachers bring to their students and the work that goes on behind the scenes.

{% newthought 'Is there a particular teacher or moment during my training that really stood out to me?' %}

Both. The entire course has been taught by Dr. Milissa Bradley. If you ever have the opportunity to take her classes, you should—even if you have no interest in becoming a yoga teacher. You will grow in so many unexpected ways that will benefit your life.

Something that continually stands out to me is how supportive, vulnerable, and hardworking my classmates are. **Seriously, they. are. awesome.**
