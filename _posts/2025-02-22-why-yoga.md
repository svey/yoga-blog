{% newthought 'What drew me to Yoga?' %}

What drew me to yoga was the need for an outlet during the pandemic. My gym had closed, and I was stuck working a desk job from home. I had a background in calisthenics, but my body was riddled with aches and pains—my back, shoulders, and core were all suffering. I ended up in physical therapy for a tight psoas and pelvic floor dysfunction. On top of that, I was stressed and alone. My mom had just finished chemo after battling breast cancer. I broke up with my girlfriend the day lockdown was announced. I was lost and searching for something...<!--more--> and I found yoga.

{% newthought 'What is it like going through my 200-hour yoga certification? How has it changed my understanding of yoga?' %}

I’m in a unique program offered through Diablo Valley Community College, and it’s been an amazing—though very challenging—experience. The material is rich, and my classmates and teacher are rad—I’m so grateful I enrolled. The homework feels endless, but I’ve learned so much from courses in anatomy, philosophy, teaching methodologies, and techniques. It’s a lot of work, both in and out of the classroom. Sometimes it’s physically demanding; other times, it’s rewarding, and often, it’s humbling. This journey has completely shifted my perspective on yoga and the people who teach it. So much knowledge, passion, and time are dedicated to the physical practice—and there is so much more to yoga than just time on the mat.

{% newthought 'Is there a particular teacher or moment during my training that really stood out to me?' %}

Both. The entire course has been taught by Dr. Melissa Bradley. If you ever have the opportunity to take her classes, you should—even if you have no interest in becoming a yoga teacher. You will grow in so many unexpected ways that will benefit your life.

Something that continually stands out to me is how supportive, vulnerable, and hardworking my classmates are. {% newthought 'WSeriously, they. are. awesome.' %}
