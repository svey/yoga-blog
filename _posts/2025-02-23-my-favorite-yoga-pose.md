{% newthought 'My favorite yoga pose, and why...' %}<!--more-->

Lately, **Adho Mukha Svanasana** (Downward Dog) has been my favorite...

I love dogs, and for my 200-hour certification capstone project, I've been creating a yoga calendar that explores the beliefs, traditions, and myths behind different poses. It's a personal interpretation, but the process has been both fun and insightful. {% sidenote 'downward-dog' 'My interpretation of Adho Mukha Svanasana was inspired by the myth of Bhairava. It's a pose that reminds us of the guidance and support we receive on our journey to liberation. Just like Bhairava's loyal dog helped him find his way as he traveled the world seeking forgiveness. Dogs are protectors of Dharma, guiding souls as they move through Karma.' %} The stories and symbolism surrounding Adho Mukha Svanasana, in particular, have really resonated with me.

Also, I'm determined to get my feet flat on the mat.
