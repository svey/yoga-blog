{% newthought 'My favorite yoga pose, and why...' %}<!--more-->

Lately, **Adho Mukha Svanasana** (Downward Dog) has been my favorite...

I love dogs, and for my 200-hour certification capstone project, I've been creating a yoga calendar that explores the beliefs, traditions, and myths behind different poses. It's a personal interpretation, but the process has been both fun and insightful. {% sidenote 'downward-dog' 'My interpretation of Adho Mukha Svanasana was inspired by the myth of Bhairava. In the story, Bhairava decapitates the fifth head of Brahma and must atone. During his journey, he relies on his dog for guidance and support on the path to liberation. In Hindu tradition, dogs are seen as guardians of Dharma, guiding souls through karma.' %} The stories and symbolism surrounding Adho Mukha Svanasana, in particular, have really resonated with me.

Also, I'm determined to get my feet flat on the mat.
