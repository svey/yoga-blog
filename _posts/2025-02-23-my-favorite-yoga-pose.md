I've been creating a yoga calendar that explores the beliefs, traditions, and myths behind different poses. It's a personal interpretation
{% sidenote "downward-dog" "In my calendar **Adho Mukha Svanasana** or **Downward Dog** was inspired by the myth of Bhairava. It reminds us of the guidance and support we receive on our path to liberation. Much like Bhairava's loyal dog, who led him in search of forgiveness, dogs protect **Dharma**, and help us navigate the ups and downs of our journey through **Karma**." %}
{% marginnote "dharma" "**Dharma** is the right way of living." %}
{% marginnote "karma" "**Karma** is our actions and their consequences." %}
but the process has been both fun and insightful.

{% marginnote "credit-doug-whipple-for-water-color" "Credit to my friend Douglas Whipple for the watercolor illustrations for my calendar." %}
Currently, Downward Dog or Adho Mukha Svanasana is my favorite. The stories and symbolism surrounding Adho Mukha Svanasana, in particular, have really resonated with me.

Also, I'm determined to get my heels down to the mat.
