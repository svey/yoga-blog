## Reflection
I've been creating a yoga calendar that explores the beliefs, traditions, and myths behind different poses. It's a personal interpretation but the process has been both fun and insightful. Currently, Downward Dog or Adho Mukha Svanasana is my favorite. The stories and symbolism surrounding Adho Mukha Svanasana, in particular, have really resonated with me.
