Balasana or Child's Pose encourages surrender, trust, and stillness. Hanuman, devoted to Rama, embodied humility, courage, and unwavering faith, acting not for self-gain but in service. In this pose, we mirror Hanuman's dedication, bowing to a purpose greater than ourselves.

## Reflection
Around spring, I usually join a couple of friends for a cemetery cleanup at the Pioneers' Cemetery in Martinez. I haven't heard from the organizer yet, but reading my interpretation of Child's Pose reminded me of [Seva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sev%C4%81){:target="_blank"}—the practice of selfless service. So, that will be my goal for the month.  

I invite anyone reading this, regardless of the time of year, to join me in giving some of yourself to something else.
