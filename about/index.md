I’m currently completing my 200-hour yoga certification—this blog is where I share my journey. My goal is to educate, inspire, and reflect—for myself and others interested in yoga. This space is dedicated to understanding, practicing, and exploring yoga.

Here, you’ll find scripts, myths, and reflections, as well as insights from my certification process, job search, and experiences as I work toward building a local presence in yoga. Everything I share is meant to be practical, insightful, and rooted in real experience.

In the future, this blog may evolve, but for now, it serves as a record of my growth and a resource for anyone looking to deepen their connection to yoga. Thank you for being here.
