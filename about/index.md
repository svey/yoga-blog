I’m currently completing my 200-hour yoga certification—I hope this blog can be an expression of my journey; educating, inspiring, and reflecting. This space is dedicated to understanding, practicing, and exploring yoga.

Everything I share is meant to be practical, insightful, and rooted in real experience as I work toward building a local presence in yoga.

[My blog]({{ site.baseurl }}) may evolve, but for now, it serves as a record of my growth and a resource for anyone looking to deepen their connection to yoga. Thank you for being here.
