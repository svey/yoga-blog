{% marginnote 'about the calendar' "The 2025 Yoga Asanas Calendar runs from March 2025 to February 2026. I didn't start working on it until January, and that's just how the timing worked out. I plan to create a 2026 calendar starting in March next year as well to continue the tradition—stay tuned.." %}

This calendar was my Yoga Teacher Training capstone project. I wanted to connect the poses to my interpretation of the stories, culture, and traditions behind them, with the hope of inviting curiosity and meaning beyond the mat for each practitioner who takes the time to appreciate the subtleties of each illustration and read the brief passages accompanying each month and asana.

I owe a BIG thank you to my good friend and neighbor, Doug Whipple, who was gracious enough to illustrate this calendar, as well as to my classmates who supported me. I am endlessly grateful. I hope you enjoy the calendar—it was truly a pleasure to create and something I am very proud of.
{% marginnote 'release schedule and purchase' 'I will release each month on the 1st, with the final page available on February 1, 2026. If you wish to purchase the 2025 Yoga Asanas Calendar, Instagram is the best way to reach me—my social icons are at the bottom of each page. Alternatively, you can email me at marcus.svehlak@gmail.com. The cost is $30 plus shipping (I make nothing).' %}
