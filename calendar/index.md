{% marginnote 'about the calendar' "The 2025 Yoga Asanas Calendar runs from March 2025 to February 2026. I didn't start working on it until January, and that's just how the timing worked out." %}

The 2025 Yoga Asanas Calendar was my Yoga Teacher Training capstone project. I wanted to connect the poses to my interpretation of the stories, culture, and traditions behind them, with the hope of inviting curiosity and meaning beyond the mat for each practitioner who takes the time to appreciate the subtleties of each illustration and read the brief passages accompanying each month and asana.

A printable version of the 2025 Yoga Asanas Calendar is available for purchase from my [**Etsy store**](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1879434874/2025-yoga-asanas-calendar)

I owe a **BIG** thank you to my good friend and neighbor, Doug Whipple, who was gracious enough to illustrate this calendar, as well as to my classmates who supported me. I am endlessly grateful. I hope you enjoy the calendarâ€”it was truly a pleasure to create and something I am very proud of.
